# Hand Gesture Detection and Tracking

This project implements a real-time hand gesture detection and tracking system using OpenCV and MediaPipe.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection
- Finger position tracking
- Gesture recognition (fingers up/down)
- FPS (Frames Per Second) display

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Create a `.env` file in your local environment and add your API key:
   ```env
   API_KEY="Your API KEY GOES HERE"
   ```
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   This will open your webcam feed and start detecting hand gestures in real-time.

## How It Works

The `HandDetector` class utilizes MediaPipe's hand tracking solution to detect and track hands in the video feed. It provides methods to:

- Detect hands in an image
- Find the positions of hand landmarks
- Determine which fingers are raised

The main loop captures video from the webcam, processes each frame to detect hands and fingers, and displays the results in real-time.
